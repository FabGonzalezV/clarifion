This project was a test for an interview that  I  presented for a job as a web developer. The Test consisted of replicating a figma design, so, my work was to replicate the same design with any technologies for front-end development, such as react or any other. 


Another task that I had to do was to deploy the project, so, I decided to deploy on firebase, because it is easy and practical. 


The characteristics for the test were just replicate the same design, if it has no functionality it's not important for the test. But the main task was to make the design responsive, and adaptable for any devices.
